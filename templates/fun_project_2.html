    Savvy is a custom HTML and JavaScript-based user interface designed for the Automatic 1111 Stable Diffusion API.
    This project was born from my desire to create a cleaner, more user-friendly alternative to the Gradio-based system,
    which I found too complex and tightly integrated into their ecosystem. Savvy focuses on simplicity, usability, and
    extensibility, providing a streamlined and intuitive experience for users. Key features include:
    <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>Multi-User Support: Users can log in, create their own accounts, and securely manage their image generation
            activities.</li>
        <li>Image Creation: Leverages the power of the Stable Diffusion API to enable users to generate stunning
            AI-powered images with ease.</li>
        <li>Global Image Sharing: Users can share their creations in a global display, fostering collaboration and
            inspirationâ€”all within a local environment.</li>
        <li>Clean and Modular Design: Built with clean code and reusable templates, ensuring maintainability and
            scalability for future enhancements.</li>
        <li>Seamless Integration: Provides all the functionality of the Stable Diffusion API without the clutter of the
            default Gradio system.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Why It Matters:</strong><br>
    Savvy reimagines how users interact with the Stable Diffusion API, offering a modern, intuitive, and efficient
    alternative to traditional tools. By enabling multiple users to collaborate and share their creations locally, it
    enhances both the functionality and the community aspect of image generation. The clean, modular design ensures that
    developers can easily extend and customize the system to meet evolving needs.
    <br><br>
    <strong style="font-size: 18px;">The Vision:</strong><br>
    Savvy is more than just a UIâ€”itâ€™s a redefinition of how AI image generation tools can be accessed and shared. My
    goal was to break free from the constraints of Gradioâ€™s ecosystem and deliver a solution that prioritizes usability
    and maintainability. With Savvy, users and developers alike have a platform that simplifies the process of creating
    and sharing AI-generated images while laying the foundation for future innovation.
