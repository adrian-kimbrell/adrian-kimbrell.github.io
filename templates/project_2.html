    At Kaleidoscope, we developed a powerful suite of investor relations widgets designed to enhance the way companies
    engage with their investors. These widgets are fully customizable and provide seamless integration into client
    websites. I led the development of the system that powers these widgets, ensuring they are efficient, scalable, and
    user-friendly. The widgets include:
    <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>SEC Filings: Display key regulatory filings to keep investors informed.</li>
        <li>Press Releases: Showcase the latest company announcements and updates.</li>
        <li>Stock Data and Charts: Real-time stock prices and interactive charts for better visualization.</li>
        <li>Analyst Ratings: Provide insights into how analysts view the stock.</li>
        <li>Historical Stock Lookup: Enable users to search for historical stock prices with ease.</li>
        <li>Investment Calculator: An interactive tool for calculating potential returns on investment.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><strong style="font-size: 18px;">How It Works:</strong><br>
    I built the backend system powering these widgets, ensuring robust functionality and seamless integration. Each
    widget is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing clients to customize its appearance and features to align with
    their brand. Once developed, the widgets are easily embeddable into client websites, offering investors a rich and
    interactive experience.
    <br><br>
    <strong style="font-size: 18px;">Why It Matters:</strong><br>
    These widgets have become a cornerstone of Kaleidoscopeâ€™s investor relations offerings, driving business growth and
    delivering value to clients. By providing real-time data, interactive tools, and a user-friendly interface, the
    widgets strengthen communication between companies and their investors, fostering trust and transparency.
    <br><br>
    As the lead developer behind the system, Iâ€™m proud to have contributed to the success of this vertical, which
    continues to expand with glowing client feedback and growing adoption across industries.
