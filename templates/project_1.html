    This project started with a simple realization: we had amassed a wealth of valuable data, and it was a no-brainer to
    create an API to share it with analysts, researchers, and hedge funds. The result was a powerful tool that opens up
    access to essential financial and corporate data, including:
    <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
        <li>SEC Filings: A streamlined way to access regulatory filings.</li>
        <li>Stock Data: Real-time and historical market insights.</li>
        <li>C-Suite Compensation: Deep dives into executive pay.</li>
        <li>Corporate Actions: Updates on mergers, dividends, and other key events.</li>
        <li>SEDAR Reports: Easy access to Canadian regulatory filings.</li>
        <li>Press Releases: Aggregated corporate announcements in one place.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Why It Matters:</strong><br>
    We didnâ€™t stop at just exposing data. I focused on adding corporate intelligence features to make this API a
    competitive alternative to Crunchbaseâ€™s offering. Itâ€™s designed to empower users with the insights they need,
    whether theyâ€™re analyzing trends, conducting research, or making investment decisions.
    <br><br>
    Building this API has been an incredible experienceâ€”translating data into actionable insights and making it
    accessible to those who need it most. From designing a scalable architecture to creating user-friendly
    documentation, this project represents my passion for solving real-world problems through technology.
